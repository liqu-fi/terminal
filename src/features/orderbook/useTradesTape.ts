/**
 * One row of the public trade tape — a settled fill or a live tick,

 *
 * @remarks `key` is the REST row's `id` for a fill; a live tick has none
 * ({@link TradeEventData} reports no id), so its key comes from the live
 * buffer's own counter. It must NOT be derived from the payload: the matcher
 * writes every fill of one match in a single loop under a shared `timestamp`,
 * and a fill's price is the maker's limit price — a taker sweeping two makers
 * at the SAME level emits two events identical in both fields. A key built
 * from them would collide, and React would silently drop one of the two rows
 * on the next re-render: the tape would undercount a real trade. `txHash` is
 * `null` for every live row for a related reason: the event never carries one,
 * and printing an explorer link anyway would assert a fact the event never
 * reported. Maker/taker role is absent from this shape entirely — the tape is
 * the public feed, and role only exists relative to one account's own history
 * (see `HistoryTable`).

/**
 * Live rows still worth showing: only events strictly newer than the freshest

 *
 * @remarks There is no id to dedupe by — a live tick simply doesn't carry one
 * (see {@link TapeRow}) — so the boundary is a timestamp, not an equality
 * check: no row is ever compared against another. A live tick that a later
 * REST page also carries stays visible until that page replaces it; it is not
 * shown twice, because the live copy sits above the page rather than beside
 * it. Nothing in the terminal makes that page arrive on a schedule:
 * `useTradesRestQuery` has no `refetchInterval` and this hook can't give it
 * one, so a refetch happens only on window focus or a remount (a market switch
 * or a tab switch back to Trades). An empty REST page (still loading, or a
 * market with no history yet) sets no boundary at all — every live row passes
 * rather than none.
 *
 * The boundary is `Math.max` over the whole page, not `restRows[0]`: the
 * gateway sorts newest-first, but nothing here enforces that, and reading only
 * the head would silently take a stale boundary from a page sorted the other
 * way. Over a correctly sorted page the two agree.
 *
 * Strict `>`, not `>=`, is deliberate: fills from one match are written in a
 * single transaction and can share the freshest REST row's `timestamp` down to
 * the millisecond (see `ListTradesQuery.cursor`'s TSDoc in the SDK) — a live
 * tick at that exact boundary may be a *different* trade from the same match,
 * not a duplicate. `>` holds it back one REST page rather than risk showing it
 * twice; a trade appearing a page late is honest, a trade shown twice is a lie
 * about what happened on the market.

 * "adjusting state when a prop changes" pattern from the React docs (same
 * one `useBookTick` uses for its own reset). `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`
 * forbids a synchronous `setState` inside an effect body precisely because it
 * costs an extra commit with stale state visible in between; doing the
 * comparison in the render body lets React fold the adjustment into the same
 * render instead. A market switch is handled by the caller mounting this hook
 * under `key={marketId}` — the freshest way to blank per-market state is to
 * let the whole component (and its `useState`) remount, not to chase the
 * change with more render-time comparisons.
